- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://https://fontawesome.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I had a challenge of placing the Image by the side of the text in the section area. I started off the design floating the image to the right but had challaenges with the responsiveness. 
I had to switch to flexbox to fix that then inversing the column arrangement to suit the design
